- I'm on US Eastern Time, so most of my content uploads/streams will happen in the afternoon for me.

## What content do I make?

- Most of my content will be centered around playing and modding Zelda games, and I'm currently into Wind Waker! I only have one major project out right now, but I plan to make additional mods and tutorials in the future!
