## General Information

- I mostly play games on my laptop and PS5, but possess several other consoles I use regularly (mostly Nintendo).
- I do use a dual PC setup for recording and streaming (specs are listed below).
- In case you were wondering, yes, I am male, and I turn 18 later this year. That's all you get.
- I'm on US Eastern Time, so most of my content uploads/streams will happen in the afternoon for me.

## What games do I play most?

It's highly likely most of the content you'll see from me will be Destiny 2, but I play many other great games on PS5, PC and Nintendo. These include Minecraft, Zelda, FFXV, and many other AAA and Indie games alike! Destiny 2 is what I enjoy the most barring burnout, so that's why I plan to make content around it!
